### Submission for the Titanic Dataset competition on Kaggle. 

### [At this time, I am limiting access for the highest ranking version of the project to friends and potential employers. Click this link if you would like to request access to the Google Drive folder containing it :smile:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D44rR_IH60kL4PmiVxaADlzzcBD65fAv/view?usp=sharing)

### Note: The code contained in this public repo is an older and lower scoring version of the project.



### Summary of higest scoring project version:

Feature engineering included extraction of probabilistic racial/ethnic data from passenger names.  

Machine Learning models were trained using these engineered features. Further EDA and statistical investigation of the effects of race/ethnicity is needed. I hope to get that done within the next couple weeks. 

### From my prelimiary EDA of race/ethnicity and it's effect on survival rates:

- The majority of passengers appear to have been British. This of course should be expected, as the Titanic set sail from Britain.Â¶
- Cultural divides appear to have caused differences even within races. Many people would consider all Europeans to be White, yet there appear to be differences in survival rates within the sub-categories of White Europeans.
- Building on the above, the Titanic sank a couple years prior to World War I. It was a British ship, and it does appear that survival odds may have favoured the British and their allies at the expense of their soon-to-be enemies in the war.
- There are races/ethnicities (such as the two asian categories) with such small sample populations that it will be difficult to gain statitistically significant insight into how their race/ethnicity affected their chances of survival.
- Ceteris Paribus: At a later time, I will do further analysis to control for the effects of other socioeconomic variables on survival rates.
